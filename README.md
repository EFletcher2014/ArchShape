# ArchShape
This program automatically creates shapefiles from archaeological excavation documentation for mapping in a GIS.

# Introduction
Archaeological excavation is an inherently destructive process. Once a site is excavated, it can never be fully reconstructed. To preserve sites for future research, archaeologists document their excavations in detailed notes, maps, and reports. Decades of archaeological excavations have created an overwhelming corpus of this "grey literature" in varying formats, predominantly paper records. As these records are rarely fully digitized or shared, they are not effective at facilitating further research.

As software such as GIS becomes more prevalent in archaeology, archaeologists must find ways to integrate it with these important grey literature datasets, or risk making decades of work obsolete. Archaeologists should emphasize efforts to create digitizing tools such as Optical Character Recognition models for archaeological records, Computational Text Analysis tools to analyze grey literature, and tools to digitize maps (a major component of archaeological documentation). 

This project aims to tackle that final issue: digitizing archaeological maps.
